In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears
at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the
spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky
and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and
destroys the aliens. If the player destroys all the aliens, a new fleet
appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits
the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player
loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game end.

Plan:
- Add a single alien to the top-left corner of the screen, with appropriate
spacing around it.

- Fill the upper portion of the screen with as many aliens as we can fit
horizontally. We'll then create additional rows of aliens until we have a
full fleet.

- Make the fleet move sideways and down until the entire fleet is shot
down, an alien hits the ship, or an alien reaches the ground. If the
entire fleet is shot down, we'll create a new fleet. If an alien hits the
ship or the ground, we'll destroy the ship and create a new fleet.

- Limit the number of ships the player can use, and end the game when
the player has used up the allotted number of ships.
