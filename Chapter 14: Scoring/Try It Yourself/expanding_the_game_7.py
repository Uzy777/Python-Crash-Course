# 14-7. Expanding the Game:     Think of a way to expand Alien Invasion. For example you could program the aliens to shoot bullets down at your ship.
#                               You can also add shields for you ship to hide behind, which can be destroyed by bullets from either side.
#                               Or you can use something like the 'pygame.mixer' module to add sound effects, such as explosions and shooting sounds.
