python manage.py makemigrations learning_logs

Pick option #1

❯ python manage.py makemigrations learning_logs
It is impossible to add a non-nullable field 'owner' to topic without specifying a default. This is because the database needs something to populate existing rows.
Please select a fix:
 1) Provide a one-off default now (will be set on all existing rows with a null value for this column)
 2) Quit and manually define a default value in models.py.
Select an option: 1
Please enter the default value as valid Python.
The datetime and django.utils.timezone modules are available, so it is possible to provide e.g. timezone.now as a value.
