# 5-1. Conditional Tests:       Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test.
#                               Your code should look something like this:
# 
#                               car = "subaru"
#                               print("Is car == subaru? I predict it will output True")
#                               print(car == "subaru")
#
#                               print("\nIs car == audi? I predict it will output False")
#                               print(car == "audi")
#                   
#                               - Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
#                               - Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.

car = "subaru"
print("Is car == subaru? I predict it will output True")
print(car == "subaru")

print("\nIs car == audi? I predict it will output False")
print(car == "audi")

food = "cake"
print("\nIs food == cake? I predict it will output True")
print(food == "cake")

print("\nIs food == chicken? I predict it will output False")
print(food == "chicken")
