# 5-7. Favourite Fruit:     Make a list of your favourite fruits, and then write a series of independent 'if' statements that check for certain fruits in your list.
#
#                           - Make a list of your three favourite fruits and call it 'favourite_fruits'.
#                           - Write five 'if' statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your list.
#                           If the fruit is in your list, the 'if' block should print a statement, such as "You really like bananas!".
