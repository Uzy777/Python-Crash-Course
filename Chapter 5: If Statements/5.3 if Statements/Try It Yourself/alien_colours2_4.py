# 5-4. Alien Colors #2:         Choose a colour for an alien as you did in Exercise 5-3, and write an 'if-else' chain.
#
#                               - If the alien's colour is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
#                               - If the alien's colour isn't green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 pints.
#                               - Write one version of this program that runs the 'if' block and another that runs the 'else' block.
