# 3-2. Greetings:   Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing each person's name, print a message to them.
#                   The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalised with the person's name.

friends = ["James", "Joe", "Rodger", "Frank", "Tim"]
print(f"Hello there {friends[0]} how are you doing today?")
print(f"Hello there {friends[1]} how are you doing today?")
print(f"Hello there {friends[2]} how are you doing today?")
print(f"Hello there {friends[3]} how are you doing today?")
print(f"Hello there {friends[4]} how are you doing today?")
