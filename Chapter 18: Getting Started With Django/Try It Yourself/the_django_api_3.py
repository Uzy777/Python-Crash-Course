# 18-3. The Django API:     When you write code to access the data in your project, you're writing a query.
#                           Skim through the documentation for querying your data at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/queries .
#                           Much of what you see will look new to you, but it will be quite useful as you start to work on your own projects.
